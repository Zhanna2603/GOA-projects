        <p>This gospel story is known to many. In general terms, the meaning of the action is clear: Pilate washed his hands as a sign that he was relieving himself of responsibility for the sentence to Jesus Christ. But it's worth taking a closer look at the . 
        <br>It was the duty of Pontius Pilate, as the Roman governor, to judge whether the accused had committed crimes against the law of the Roman Empire. Jesus Christ was accused of claiming real power in the country and forbidding paying taxes to the emperor <i>(Lk 23: 2).</i> Pilate concluded that the political accusation was unfounded. He wanted to release Jesus, but the crowd, incited by the chief priests, demanded His death. Whatever tricks Pilate tried, the crowd grew more and more furious, until finally he was threatened with the wrath of the Emperor Tiberius himself <i>(Jn 19: 12).</i>
        <br>This threat swept away the remnants of Pilate's courage. The denunciation could interrupt not only his career, but also his life. He knew the emperor's suspicion, treachery, and cruelty, and he also knew that the Jewish leaders had already complained about him to Tiberius. Pilate did not risk his life for the sake of a Preacher of a truth in which he did not believe, and therefore decided to hand Jesus over to His enemies.
        <br>But before he could do this, Pilate took water and washed his hands in front of the crowd <i>(Mt 27:24).</i> This rite is mentioned by many ancient authors, such as Homer, Euripides, Ovid, and Seneca, but it was primarily characteristic of Jewish culture and prescribed by the law of Moses itself. For example, if a slain person was found and there was no suspicion of the murderer, the elders of the city would wash their hands over the head of the sacrificial heifer and announce the following:: Our hands have not shed this blood, nor have our eyes seen it; make atonement for your people Israel, whom You, O Lord, have made free, and do not impute innocent blood to your people Israel <i>(Deut 21:7-8). </i>The Jews also had many other ablutions that removed ritual impurity from a person.
        <br>Pontius Pilate also performed this rite in his own way. By doing so, he wanted to calm his conscience, which was tormenting him for condemning an innocent person, at least a little, and explain to the Jews in a way that they understood that he was forced to accept this sentence, under the pressure of the Jewish elders. In fact, this did not relieve him of guilt, he made a deal with his conscience, succumbing to cowardice and revealing his cowardice. St. Demetrius of Rostov says: "It is not in water, but in the true Blood of the good-natured Lamb, that the lawless Pilate washes his hands. This ungodly man should have heard what God says through the prophet Jeremiah: "Wash away your heart from wickedness, and you will be saved" <i>(Jer 4:14).</i> He washes his hands, but with a heart full of uncleanness, deceit, and malice, he condemns the innocent to death."
        <br>In the languages of peoples familiar with the Gospel, this event of Sacred history gave rise to the popular expression "I wash my hands of it", that is, I release myself from responsibility.</p>
