    <title>Robin Hood. 2010</title>

    <h1>Robin Hood. 2010</h1>

    <p>Ridley Scott is a very controversial director. And uneven. He works in a wide variety of genres, from drama to science fiction, and his results range from classics of the genre to utter bullshit. Let's remember how he started out... Strong realistic "Duelists", then immediately the classic fantasy film "Alien", then the magnificent fantastic thriller "Blade Runner", the most powerful crime drama "Black Rain" and the classic road movie "Thelma and Louise". And then, all of a sudden, the totally stupid war drama Soldier Jane. And after" Jane " Scott came to a completely new genre for himself - historical cranberries. In this genre, he made the film "Gladiator" with an unthinkable budget of a hundred lemons at that time, and although critics for the idiocy of the script on Scott were trampled so that there was no living space left on it, the audience was overwhelmed by the picture and it collected at the world box office under half a billion. Well, on IMDB is worth at 96th place in the Top250 best movies of all time, so guys, who is the fool at all, Scott periodically asks the critics.
        <br>Scott later returned to the genre of historical cranberries. It made the movie "Kingdom of Heaven", which, unlike "Gladiator", and the noise did not cause, and the box office did not collect. But it is not surprising: despite all the solidity of the production, it is impossible to say what this film is about within fifteen minutes after the end of viewing. All you remember is that some bloke is pretending to be an Ironbane guy, and Vesper Lind, the accountant, is riding around him, and that's all.
        <br>But Scott, like the legendary old man who had a cottage right next to the blue sea, threw a net into the sea for the third time. Well, he wanted to repeat the success of "Gladiator", he really wanted to. So old Scott decided to take the well-trodden path: take a scowling Australian lad named Russell Crowe, and stick all sorts of respectable entourage around him - you know, so that swords could be used for fencing, so that arrows could fly back and forth with a good whistle, so that blood, stink, mud, dogs of all sorts-in short, to the historical Yes, but as required by all the stupid Hollywood laws. And one of these laws says: when a project has Russell Crowe and a couple of hundred million dollars for production, it doesn't matter who is there for whom, against whom and instead of whom.
        <br>Even so, Ridley Scott's choice of script was surprising. Because Robin Hood. Prince of Thieves. A guy in green tights, the leader of a gang of non-gay, but nevertheless funny guys, Marion's admirer and such a cool archer that all the squirrels in Sherwood Forest run one-eyed.
        <br>It would seem - what the hell is Robin? We are silent about the fact that the Robin Hood stories were filmed exactly eighty-six (!) times - after all, who in Hollywood did that stop? But in 1991, Kevin Reynolds did with Kevin Costner his Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves-a very good production, which, with a budget of fifty million dollars, grossed almost four hundred worldwide-mainly, however, because of the brilliant Sheriff of Nottingham, superbly played by Alan Rickman. Costner tried to attribute the box office credit to his unbreakable charm, but old Kevin would have been better off keeping an eye on Whitney Houston instead.
        <br>Well, in 1993, Mel Brooks made one of his best parodies of the Reynolds film "Robin Hood-men in tights", and this topic, of course, could be closed forever.
        <br>And yet! Take Robin Hood, period, Scott said. Because it's like "Gladiator": everyone also goes in chain mail, with swords, fights, drinks, well, plus-love with Marion, and the audience loves it. Only, Scott said, we'll go the other way! No more thieves! We're going to be like a prequel to a sequel! Let Robin Hood not be the prince of thieves yet! We will show the formation of a young Robin Hood. We will explore exactly how he became the prince of thieves - due to some such life perturbations. And, of course, we will shoot a lot of Rubilov in the most dramatic and realistic colors. As old Ridley said, we all do.

        <br>Said and done. The producers took about ten writers who were swollen up from the endless strike and gave them a task: so the top was made for us by Robin Hood, but so that it wasn't Robin Hood or the Prince of thieves. And no tights, of course! But Rubilov is bigger, Rubilov. Plus-love and drama. Loyalty to duty and family values. Patriotism and meanness of those in power. But not all the powers that be, but just one Prince John with an arrow in his tailbone! Oh, and don't forget the Scoundrel - Mark Strong has already promised to play him. Only top he wasn't a fucking sheriff - where did our American sheriffs come from in this English backwater? In general, guys, the main thing here is not to go down the beaten path.
        <br>The scriptwriters, of course, were screwed. Not a fig to yourself given an order to us to the West, said the writers. Immediately - in a completely different direction! How can you write about Robin Hood without green tights? And don't let glavgad be the Sheriff of Nottingham! And the most important thing is that he is not the prince of thieves! And who is he a prince of? Home seamstresses?!!
        <br>But since Hollywood screenwriters are hard-core people, they sat down to light up the full program. And they burned napalm first in one direction, then in the other. At first, the Sheriff of Nottingham was made very good and progressive. Then they began to build a script around Richard the Lionheart, who returned home and began to fight the vile Arabs with the help of his friend and, I'm not afraid of this word, the popular archer Robin Hood. But then they remembered why that bastard Richard got his nickname in the first place, and they decided that he wasn't worthy to go home - let him die like a dog, since he was such a knacker and a brute. In short, the process was well underway, and the writers ' brains were boiling with tension.
        <br>And what did it turn out to be? It turned out to be the most weighty sweet and sour Hollywood cranberries, whose cranberry content significantly exceeds even the "Gladiator". However, in their idiocy, the scriptwriters have reached such heights of the lowlands that no one will even create sites from the series "285 absurdities of the new Scott film", as they did with"Gladiator". Because the whole Robin Hood thing is just a MAN IN TIGHTS.
        <br>But let's talk a little bit about the plot. Robin isn't even a Hood here, just the son of stonemason Robin Longstreid. He fights as an archer in Richard the Lionheart's squad, and in his spare time works as a three-thimble katala-breeding suckers from the squad. Once a soldier named Little John (Kevin Durand), who was neither little nor John, tried to catch Robin in a lie - they say, firstly, he is not Robin, but Batman, and secondly, he makes fools of honest boys. There was a strong male fight, which was broken up by King Richard himself. When asked who was the first to indulge and fight, Robin honestly admitted that it was him. Richard was glad that he had found the only honest man in the squad, and he demanded unflattering criticism. Then Robin turned around. He recalled to the king the massacre of two thousand Moslems at Acre, the failure to pay taxes in 1190-1195, and admitted that Richard was called the Vile Bastard in the army, and Lionheart was called so for show.
        <br>Richard, of course, was a little upset, and ordered Robin, Little John, Will, and Allan, all of whom were standing around listening to these blasphemous words, to be put in the stocks. The boys are supposed to be executed at dawn.
        <br>But then providence intervened. The dastardly Sir Godfrey (Mark Strong), Prince John's foster brother, sold himself to King Philip of France for oysters and the Chateau Latour of 1112. Godfrey and a squad of French bats are looking for Richard to kill him, but he died safely on his own, so Robin and the party escaped.
        <br>On her way to the sea, Robin discovers the dying Sir Robert Locksley, who is taking Richard's crown to the Queen Mother. Robert asks Robin to take the crown and return the old Walter Locksley (Max von Sydow) sword, which Robert took just to wear and wave. Robert was bleeding profusely at the same time, and as a result, Robin swore a blood oath.
        <br>Now it became clear what to do. Robin and his companions changed into knightly clothes and went on a ship to England, posing as Robert Locksley. There they were taken straight to Buckingham Palace, where Robin gave the Queen Mother the crown of Richard the Lionheart, and the Queen Mother immediately named Prince John king, who was fornicating with some French mamselle. John was delighted to give Robin a ring with an expensive stone, but then he remembered that Locksley had a debt on the lease of the castle, so he did not give the ring.
        <br>Robin went to Locksley to give Walter the sword of his dead son. Old Walter accepted Robin as his own - especially after he, in turn, took a bath that he hadn't seen in twenty years - and also offered to be considered Robert and make full use of Robert's wife Marion (Kate Blanchett). Well, here's the deal... If word got out that Robert was dead, Marion would be stripped of everything. And when she is with her husband, then everything is in order. Who in the world remembers what Robert looked like when he hadn't been on a business trip abroad in the last thirty years, right? Besides, the Sheriff of Nottingham is trying to get Marion into trouble, and Robin will let him clear his throat. Robin accepts the invitation and officially becomes like Robert.
        <br>Meanwhile, Prince John had asked his henchman, Sir Godfrey, to make sure that taxes were collected from any barons who had gone awry. Godfrey, as a French spy, brings his squad of French saboteurs to England, and they beat money out of the barons until the last breath of the barons themselves and all the barons ' servants.
        <br>Of course, unrest begins in the country. The barons are going to war on Prince John, the French King Philip is preparing to land troops from Normandy - in general, England is in Danger! And only Robin, as a great commander and a wise strategist, can help England defend its independence from fried frog legs. After all, better the bitter ale of the motherland than these French "Grand Crus"! The enemy will not pass! The victory will be ours! And let the French advance from the sea with their old battle cry of " Voulez-vous coucher avec moi!", the English patriots will be able to defend their native land from all sorts of d'artagnans!
        <br>Yes, yes, that's exactly the kind of idiocy they removed. Some lousy archers pretend to be knights and get an audience in the palace. Robin is supposedly made Robert, and he chases all sorts of shnyaga about the fact that he promised the stonemason pope to protect his Homeland very much, and to rise up before the goats become lambs. So this isn't Robin anymore, but some prince in disguise, God forgive me. And when, at the end of a month, he begins to command the entire English army during the landing of the French - then I realized that this is really d'Artagnan in disguise.
        <br>Prince John is something completely caricatured (just in the Mel Brooks parody, Prince John was much less stupid) and behaves like a home-made clown.
        The Sheriff of Nottingham has only one name left - he hits on Marion a couple of times and finally betrays his homeland once or twice. There was nothing left of the grim and sinister figure at all.
        <br>Robin's friends suffered the same fate: why Little John, Will, and Allan are here at all is completely unclear. Only their names remained.

        Father Tuck, however, is involved in a couple of episodes, but he is something like the local Luzhkov-he breeds honey and makes a roof-bearing mead.In fact, almost the entire film is Robin's wanderings around the Locksley estate, suffering for his Homeland and gradually increasing shura-mura with Marion. Like a romantic story at the same time as the reinforced concrete pathos from the series "And who will protect our native England, our mother".

        Some forest waifs, directed by Marion, were shoved into the picture to the hilt: at the end of the film, she would personally lead these waifs into battle to the great delight of the audience.
        <br>It's very depressing to look at all this. Because they made a good old story out of you don't know what. There are only real battles at the very beginning and very end, but the final battle is also impossible to watch without laughing, because there is a pure beginning of "Save Private Ryan" - landing in Normandy, and the French are delivered like World War II seals - I kept waiting for the decks of these strange wooden ships to start take off helicopters.Crowe tries very hard and pretends that he is very concerned about the fate of England, along with the charms of Marion, but, as in the case of a good actress Kate Blenchett, this is simply not a good feed: it is impossible to play well what by definition looks like complete idiocy.Mark Strong is also doing his best, but I think he's already a little hardened in the roles of scoundrels on the way out, so it doesn't look like a fountain here: such a caricatured villain still more or less rolled in Guy Ritchie's banter "Sherlock Holmes", and here, when we are being shoved like a historical movie, this one is strictly the black-and-white cardboard scoundrel only adds to the picture's disadvantages.Well, I was also surprised by the presence of a considerable number of completely student cliches like this Robin's "nooo" in slow motion, when Marion, who was chopping here and there with men, suddenly fell into the water.

        As a result, the film disappointed immensely. Against the background of the general scenario madhouse, no real intrigue turned out, there are quite a few combat scenes, most of the characters are introduced into the picture exclusively for furniture, and it's just boring to watch it all. I don't even want to have fun with the exploding brains of screenwriters - all this is just annoying.
        
        However, the film has a good rating on IMDB. But it is also understandable: the American audience does not care about all these claims of mine, they consider it a "historical action movie" and they clearly do not watch it without pleasure. To be honest, I envy them. I would also really like to genuinely enjoy any madhouse.</p>
