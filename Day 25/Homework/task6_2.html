    <h1>The Healer:Avicenna's Disciple.2013</h1>

    <p>Kingdom of England, XI century. 11-year-old Rob Cole's mother dies of a bowel disease, after which he asks to travel with a traveling medicine man Barber and he teaches him his craft. But soon this is not enough for Robert, as he realizes that such skills are powerless against many diseases. From the Jewish doctors who cured Barber of his blindness, he learns that far to the east, in Persia, lives the greatest healer in the world â€” Avicenna. Rob sets out across France, the Mediterranean, and Egypt to become his apprentice.

        <br>After learning that Christians East, Cole pretends to be a Jew: he circumcises himself and begins calling himself Yessiah, the son of Beniamin (this was the name of the children of the Jewish doctor who treated Barber, and Rob did not know any other Jewish names). From Egypt to Persia, Rob goes with a caravan, where he meets a girl named Rebecca, who is destined to marry a rich Jew named Bar Kappar. However, a sandstorm killed the travelers, and only Robert managed to reach Isfahan.
        
        <br>Already in the city, Rob appeals to the Avicenna madrasa to accept him as an apprentice, but the arrogant secretary orders the alien to be thrown out. The guards beat up the Englishman. Avicenna, who was passing by, picked him up on the street, provided him with medical assistance, and seeing the young man's interest in medicine, accepted him as an apprentice. Having no money to live on, Rob continues to call himself a Jew and finds shelter in the Jewish community, where he learns that Rebecca was not killed in a sandstorm, but was saved by a caravan guide. Soon the girl is married off against her will to Bar-Kappara.
        
        <br>In parallel, the plot of the struggle of the tolerant and patronizing Shah Ala-ad-Daul with the radical Muslim elite, who entered into an alliance with the nomadic Seljuks, develops. In the course of this struggle, a person with the plague is thrown into the city. Avicenna and her students stay in the city and manage to overcome the epidemic. They learn that the plague is carried by fleas that live on rats. Rob also guesses that the infected corpses should be burned, as the plague fleas begin to look for new victims.
        
        <br>Rebekah is also treated at the madrasa. Her husband left her, fleeing the city. When the peak of her illness is over, Rob lets her go out for walks. During one of them, they can not restrain the rush of passion and the girl subsequently becomes pregnant. When her husband finds out about this, the case goes to court.
        
        <br>At this time, Avicenna and Yessiah were accused of "witchcraft." Islam does not allow dissection of corpses, and Rob, in a thirst for knowledge, secretly dissects the body of an old Zoroastrian, who bequeathed to give his body to the birds of prey. Imprisoned and awaiting execution, Rob and Avicenna nevertheless have a lively discussion about the autopsy results.
        
        <br>Meanwhile, the Shah, who is preparing for battle with the Seljuks, feels a sharp pain in his stomach. After learning about the execution of Rob and Avicenna, he sends guards to the trial. Archers kill most of the traitorous preacher's gang, but he manages to escape. Rob also asks Shah to save Rebecca, and the guards stop her trial. Doctors successfully perform an operation to remove the shah's appendix.
        
        <br>The Seljuks have already begun to storm the city. Avicenna, Yessiah, and the guards clear the city's neighborhoods to save the locals and retreat through the East Gate. Bandaged, barely able to stand on his feet, Shah Ala-ad-Daula personally goes out with the army to battle and heroically dies there.
        
        <br>Rob remembers about Avicenna and runs to the madrasa. But he had already taken the poison, knowing that his time had passed. The old healer hands him a book of his writings and asks Rob to complete his work. The Seljuks capture Isfahan and launch a massive invasion of Persia. Rob and his wife leave for England and establish a sanitarium in London. Old Barber finds out about this at one of his performances. In the last shots, he goes to the hospital to see his student.</p>
