        <h1>Ben Hur.2016</h1>

    <img src="Ben Hur.jpg">

    <p>Judah Ben-Hur is a Jewish nobleman of the Roman expansion, who lives in Jerusalem with his family and his adopted brother Messala, the son of one of the conspirators involved in the assassination of Caesar. Judah, despite his status, wants to marry for love, not convenience, seeking the favor of Esther-his servant and the daughter of a friend of his family. But at the same time, he is estranged from Messala: he is burdened by the shameful past of his ancestors, and to clear his name, he joins the Roman army to suppress rebellions in Germany.

        <br>3 years pass. Judah and Esther discuss the anti-Roman revolts of the Zealots, recently embittered by the actions of the Roman governor (for the construction of the Colosseum in Jerusalem, the Romans collect stones from anywhere, even destroying Jewish graves for this), but they themselves refuse to take sides, hoping for a peaceful settlement of the conflict. At the same time, Judah meets a local carpenter named Jesus. That same evening, several Zealots make their way to their estate, one of whom — Dismas-was injured in a skirmish with legionnaires. Judah treats Dismas and allows him to stay at his estate for a while, but drives his friends away. Judah tries to convince Dismas himself of the senselessness of violence against the Romans and the need to seek peace between their peoples, but Dismas does not take him seriously.
        
        <br>At the same time, Messala, who has risen to the rank of legate, returns to Jerusalem to visit a childhood friend. Messala says that he is serving under Pontius Pilate, who wants to lead the parade of his legion through the streets of Jerusalem, which in no case should not be disrupted. Judah promises that he will convince other Jewish aristocratic families not to do anything, but refuses to give Messala the names of radicals from the local nobility. Messala is outraged by his refusal, but can't do anything about it.
        
        <br>The next day, the legion marches through the streets of Jerusalem. During a procession near Judah's house, Dismas shoots a bow at Pilate, but the legion's standard-bearer is killed instead. The legionnaires break into Judah's house, kill Esther's father, and arrest everyone except Esther herself, who managed to escape. To protect her family, Judah takes the blame for the assassination attempt, while begging Messala to help. However, Messala refuses to help him, remembering yesterday's refusal (and also not wanting to get into another skirmish with Pilate, with whom he already has a strained relationship). Judah's mother and sister are sentenced to death by crucifixion, while he is sent to hard labor as a galley oarsman.
        
        <br>5 years pass, during which Judah, already resigned to his fate as a slave, just tries to survive. The 3rd Roman fleet he serves on is at war with Greece and is moving towards its southern coast when it runs into the Greek fleet. His galley is wrecked and drowned, but Judah manages to survive, and the sea current carries him to the north coast of Africa, where he is found by the Nubian Sheikh Ilderim, who earns money by racing chariots. Ilderim wants to hand Judah over to the Romans as a runaway slave, but Judah convinces him to keep him, demonstrating his horsemanship and horse care skills.
        
        <br>Ilderim's caravan reaches Jerusalem. Judah, under cover of night, visits Esther, who has become a follower of Jesus. She also informs him of the deaths of his loved ones and that Messala is now an honorary citizen of Rome. After luring Messala to his empty estate, Judah tries to explain herself to him, but Messala angers him, and Judah escapes by punching him in the face. Pilate, seeing Messala beaten, demands that several Jews be crucified — as a warning for trying to at least touch one of his soldiers. Esther, who narrowly escaped crucifixion, finds Judah and scolds him for his thirst for revenge, which turned into a senseless death of people. Judah asks Ilderim for advice on how to get justice and take revenge on the Romans for their torment. The sheikh tells him that the best way to put the Romans in their place is to beat their best rider in a fair contest: this will damage the prestige of the empire in their colonies and trample on Roman pride. After learning that Messala is Rome's best rider in Jerusalem, Judah asks Ilderim to sign him up for the race. Ilderim, when meeting Pilate, unsuccessfully tries to provoke him to bet, until he raises the bet: if Judah wins, all charges will be dropped, and if he loses, he will allow the Romans to take him back.
        
        <br>Upon learning of the upcoming contest, Esther tries to dissuade Judah and Messala from this pointless duel, but to no avail. On the eve of the race, Drusus, a former Roman soldier and Messala's henchman, comes to the camp, expelled from the legion. Drusus informs Judah that his mother and sister are still alive — other women were crucified in their place, and Drusus hid them both in a Jewish monastery near Jerusalem out of old friendship. The reunion with his family is overshadowed by the fact that Judah's loved ones are infected with leprosy and drive him away in delirium. Judah is angry and wants to defeat Messala at all costs.
        
        <br>Racing day is coming. Despite his fierce rivalry with Messala and the other riders, Judah, following Ilderim's instructions, still wins the race, paying dividends to the sheikh and encouraging the Jews who watched the race. However, in the evening of the same day, Judah confesses to Ilderim that having taken revenge on Messala, he lost the point of moving on: Messala is probably dead, and his mother and sister will soon be stricken with the disease. Ilderim invites Judah to join his caravan and go with him to the desert. Meanwhile, in the Garden of Gethsemane, the Romans arrest Jesus on Pilate's orders and sentence him to be crucified on Mount Calvary. When Judah sees an exhausted Jesus during the procession with the cross, he wants to give him water, as Jesus did in their last meeting 5 years ago, but he is beaten by a legionary driver, and Jesus convinces him to give up revenge on the Romans. After Jesus ' death on the cross, it begins to rain, during which Judah's mother and sister are cured of leprosy. Before leaving Jerusalem, Judah finds Messala, who is still alive but has lost his leg, and curses Judah. He asks for his forgiveness for succumbing to anger from resentment and betraying his own principles, which he himself once professed. Messala realizes that he has no one else left but Judah, and repents of his sins.
        
        <br>The newly reunited brothers, along with Judah's family and Ilderim's caravan, leave Jerusalem forever. In the last scene, Judah and Messala are once again racing horses, as they did in the old days of their youth...</p>
