    <h1>Early life and education</h1>
    <p>Bullock was born on July 26, 1964, in Arlington County, Virginia,[1] the daughter of Helga Mathilde (née Meyer; 1942–2000), an opera singer and voice teacher from Germany, and John Wilson Bullock[2] (1925–2018), an Army employee and part-time voice coach from Birmingham, Alabama.[3][4][5] Her father, who was in charge of the Army's Military Postal Service in Europe, was stationed in Nuremberg when he met her mother.[6] Her parents married in Germany. Bullock's maternal grandfather was a German rocket scientist from Nuremberg.[7] The family returned to Arlington, where her father worked with the Army Materiel Command before becoming a contractor for The Pentagon.[6][8][9] Bullock has a younger sister, Gesine Bullock-Prado, who served as president of Bullock's production company Fortis Films.[10]

        For 12 years, Bullock lived in Nuremberg, West Germany, and Vienna and Salzburg, Austria,[11] and grew up speaking German.[12] She had a Waldorf education in Nuremberg.[13][11] As a child, while her mother went on European opera tours, Bullock usually stayed with her aunt Christl and cousin Susanne, the latter of whom later married politician Peter Ramsauer.[14] Bullock studied ballet and vocal arts as a child and frequently accompanied her mother, taking small parts in her opera productions.[15] In Nuremberg, she sang in the opera's children's choir.[16] Bullock has a scar above her left eye which was caused by a fall into a creek when she was a child.[17][18] While she maintains her American citizenship, she applied for German citizenship in 2009.[12]
        
        Bullock attended Washington-Lee High School, where she was a cheerleader and performed in school theater productions. After graduating in 1982, she attended East Carolina University in Greenville, North Carolina, where she received a BFA in Drama in 1987.[19] While at East Carolina, she performed in theater productions, including Peter Pan and Three Sisters.[20] She then moved to Manhattan, New York, where she supported herself as a bartender, cocktail waitress, and coat checker while auditioning for roles.</p>
