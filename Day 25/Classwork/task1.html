<h2></h2>
<p>One of the highest-grossing American films of 2009, a family melodrama based on the true story of National Football League star <b>Michael Oere.</b> Michael (<a>Quinton Aaron</a>) didn't have a family, nor did he have the opportunity to play football. But his foster family gave him a chance to become one of America's most promising athletes. This is a poignant story about kindness, hope and family values.</p>

<p>At the center of the melodrama is <i>Lee Ann Tuo</i>(<a>Bullock</a>), a mother of two and a successful decorator living in an affluent Memphis neighborhood. A tireless optimist with a kind heart, she draws attention to a freezing 17-year-old homeless man from the black quarter. Lee Ann invites the teenager to celebrate Thanksgiving with her family, is interested in his studies and encourages Michael's friendship with her children. Michael gradually becomes a member of the friendly Tuo family. Thanks to their support, he passes school exams and applies for a sports scholarship to a prestigious college. Before he becomes a student and a professional football player, Michael will face difficulties more than once. But a simple act of kindness has already radically changed his life, giving him hope for the future.</p>



<p>The film tells about the events that happened just a few years ago. The real <b>Michael Ohr</b>is now successfully playing for the Baltimore Ravens team. Tuo first told their story in a short interview with journalist and family friend <b>Michael Lewis</b>.Impressed by their story, Lewis wrote the book "The Invisible Side:<em>The Evolution of the Game.</em>" The family still can't believe that their private story turned into a bestseller and then into a Hollywood movie. Feeling responsible to their characters, director <b>John Lee Hancock</b> and the actors paid special attention to the truthfulness of the portrayal of the characters and personally met with the Tuo family.</p>
