    <h2>Popular video formats</h2>
    <p>
        <br>A user who is going to shoot videos should be guided by their formats, take into account the advantages and disadvantages in advance.
        <br>The most common video formats:
        <br><i style="color: rgb(35, 150, 40);">MP4</i> (fully MPEG-4 Part 14) is a format compatible with most browsers and supported by video streaming sites, in particular YouTube. Video and audio tracks are compressed separately. The video is packaged with the MPEG-4 codec. Compression provides high video quality (HD) with a relatively small file size.
        <br><i style="color: rgb(29, 80, 146);">M4P</i> (iTunes Music Store Audio File), M4V (iTunes Video File) are formats developed by Apple and similar to MP4. The data can be protected by the DRM system. To play the file, you need to authorize your computer in Apple iTunes. To play on Windows devices, you need to convert the file to MP4 format.
        <br><i style="color: rgb(240, 220, 41);">AVI</i> (Audio Video Interleave) is an old format developed by Microsoft. It is supported by most popular browsers running on Windows, Macintosh and Linux systems. Data compression is less than in MP4.
        <br><i style="color: rgb(211, 42, 233);">MPG, MPEG, MP2, MPE, MPV</i> are formats characterized by a low level of compression. The quality is low, and it may deteriorate when editing and saving the finished file. Videos are usually recorded in these formats, which will not need to be edited later.
        <br><i style="color: rgb(241, 44, 159);">MOV</i> is a format developed by Apple. The video is saved in good quality, but the file takes up a lot of space. Files are played using the QuickTime Player, there are versions of this program for macOS and Windows.
        <br><i style="color: rgb(30, 238, 186);">MKV</i> is a format that allows you to record several audio tracks and subtitles in one file. Files can be viewed both on a computer and on mobile devices.
        <br><i style="color: rgb(243, 51, 44);">WebM</i> is a format that allows you to receive small–sized, medium-quality videos. Videos in this format are suitable for YouTube and other HTML5 video streaming sites.
        <br><i style="color: rgb(94, 44, 231);">OGG</i> is a file format for streaming over Internet channels. The video and audio quality is better than WebM files, but the transfer rate is lower.
        <br><i style="color: rgb(243, 160, 37);">FLV</i> is a flash video format, both streaming and progressive file downloads are possible. But Flash Player is not supported by devices running iOS.
        <br><i style="color: rgb(255, 100, 203);">WMV</i> (Windows Media Video) is a file format for streaming and email. The compression level is very high, the files are compact, but because of this, the quality suffers greatly.

    <h3>Which video format is the smallest</h3>
    <p>
        The choice of codec and container is almost always a compromise between the final file size and video quality. The higher the quality of video and audio streams, the larger the file size and the more acute the problem of compressing data to an acceptable size. When searching for the codec that most compactly records media data into a container, you should consider how the resulting file will be viewed. For example, the H.265 (HEVC) codec has proven itself to be excellent, using highly efficient compression algorithms without loss of quality. It is used to package 8K video. But not all popular browsers support this codec. The file packaged with the H.265 codec cannot be viewed on every device. In addition, a license fee is charged for the use of H.265.

        <br>The best option for medium–quality videos hosted on the Web is the open (free) H.264, VP8 and its successor VP9 video codecs in combination with the WebM container format.

    <h4>How to choose the best format</h4>
    <p>
        There is simply no abstract better video file format. The choice of format depends on what the creator of the film or video is going to do with it: send it by e-mail, post it on social networks or on YouTube, just store it on disk. For example, the quality of WMV videos leaves much to be desired, so they are rarely posted on the Internet. But, thanks to its compactness, it is very convenient to send files in this format by e-mail.
