    <h2><i>Popular video formats</i></h2>
    <p>
        A user who is going to shoot videos should be guided by their formats, take into account the advantages and disadvantages in advance.
        <br>The most common video formats:
        <br><i style="color: rgb(35, 150, 40);">MP4</i> (fully MPEG-4 Part 14) is a format compatible with most browsers and supported by video streaming sites, in particular YouTube. Video and audio tracks are compressed separately. The video is packaged with the MPEG-4 codec. Compression provides high video quality (HD) with a relatively small file size.
        <br><i style="color: rgb(29, 80, 146);">M4P</i> (iTunes Music Store Audio File), M4V (iTunes Video File) are formats developed by Apple and similar to MP4. The data can be protected by the DRM system. To play the file, you need to authorize your computer in Apple iTunes. To play on Windows devices, you need to convert the file to MP4 format.
        <br><i style="color: rgb(240, 220, 41);">AVI</i> (Audio Video Interleave) is an old format developed by Microsoft. It is supported by most popular browsers running on Windows, Macintosh and Linux systems. Data compression is less than in MP4.
        <br><i style="color: rgb(211, 42, 233);">MPG, MPEG, MP2, MPE, MPV</i> are formats characterized by a low level of compression. The quality is low, and it may deteriorate when editing and saving the finished file. Videos are usually recorded in these formats, which will not need to be edited later.
        <br><i style="color: rgb(241, 44, 159);">MOV</i> is a format developed by Apple. The video is saved in good quality, but the file takes up a lot of space. Files are played using the QuickTime Player, there are versions of this program for macOS and Windows.
        <br><i style="color: rgb(30, 238, 186);">MKV</i> is a format that allows you to record several audio tracks and subtitles in one file. Files can be viewed both on a computer and on mobile devices.
        <br><i style="color: rgb(243, 51, 44);">WebM</i> is a format that allows you to receive small–sized, medium-quality videos. Videos in this format are suitable for YouTube and other HTML5 video streaming sites.
        <br><i style="color: rgb(94, 44, 231);">OGG</i> is a file format for streaming over Internet channels. The video and audio quality is better than WebM files, but the transfer rate is lower.
        <br><i style="color: rgb(243, 160, 37);">FLV</i> is a flash video format, both streaming and progressive file downloads are possible. But Flash Player is not supported by devices running iOS.
        <br><i style="color: rgb(255, 100, 203);">WMV</i> (Windows Media Video) is a file format for streaming and email. The compression level is very high, the files are compact, but because of this, the quality suffers greatly.

    <h3><u>Which video format is the smallest</u></h3>
    <p>
        The choice of codec and container is almost always a compromise between the final file size and video quality. The higher the quality of video and audio streams, the larger the file size and the more acute the problem of compressing data to an acceptable size. When searching for the codec that most compactly records media data into a container, you should consider how the resulting file will be viewed. For example, the H.265 (HEVC) codec has proven itself to be excellent, using highly efficient compression algorithms without loss of quality. It is used to package 8K video. But not all popular browsers support this codec. The file packaged with the H.265 codec cannot be viewed on every device. In addition, a license fee is charged for the use of H.265.

        <br>The best option for medium–quality videos hosted on the Web is the open (free) H.264, VP8 and its successor VP9 video codecs in combination with the WebM container format.
    </p>

    <h4><u>How to choose the best format</u></h4>
    <p>
        There is simply no abstract better video file format. The choice of format depends on what the creator of the film or video is going to do with it: send it by e-mail, post it on social networks or on YouTube, just store it on disk. For example, the quality of WMV videos leaves much to be desired, so they are rarely posted on the Internet. But, thanks to its compactness, it is very convenient to send files in this format by e-mail.

    <h2><i>High-quality music formats</i></h2>
<p>
    <i style="color: #1dec7a;">PCM (pulse code modulation)</i> – pulse code modulation of analog audio into digital. Simply put, this is a modern type of encoding analog signals into digital audio as is – without compression. These are the audio tracks that are usually used on discs with licensed films – on the speaker system of a cool home theater, they sound impressively realistic. Less often, but still, this format is used to store concert audio recordings, classical music, operas and operettas for playback of recordings on fairly powerful, usually professional equipment.
    
    <br><i style="color: #264ae7;">WAV/WAVE (Waveform audio format)</i> – is not a new format, which appeared in 1991, one of the first varieties of multimedia containers for storing uncompressed audio. In fairness, it should be noted that WAV is now used less often, sometimes even for storing lossless compressed audio tracks. It cannot be called compact, like all uncompressed types of audio formats, this one greedily consumes space on the drive - a minute of sound will weigh no less than 4-5 MB. Allowing yourself to waste space on the drive so recklessly makes sense only if you plan to listen to the audio on professional speakers or use it, for example, for mixing, mastering, editing professional videos and clips.
    <br><i style="color: #f72955;">AIFF (Audio Interchange File Format)</i> is another very professional type of container developed by Apple. As you know, the "apple" company has always paid a lot of attention to high-quality sound, and all types of portable players from the manufacturer without exception had support for this uncompressed format, allowing musicians and music gourmets to enjoy almost perfect sound. In terms of gluttony for occupied memory, it is not inferior to WAV, just a minute of sound in AIFF (44.1 kHz, 16 bit) is about 10 MB of disk space. Files with this extension contain several clusters: standard, marker, instrumental, commentary, application, title, copyright, description, audio, as well as MIDI and ID3 data. Inside the Apple multimedia container there may be pure PCM or something simpler.

<h3><i>Compressed music formats with and without losses</i></h3>
<p>
    When codecs that compress data are used when converting analog music to digital, partial data loss occurs in any case. But in the case of so-called lossless compression, the sound quality is maintained at a fairly high level - only professionals will notice the differences from uncompressed digital audio, and only if they listen to it on PRO-level audio equipment.

<br>Lossy compression allows you to make music as compact as possible, for which you will have to pay with mediocre sound quality. However, you will only be able to notice all the shortcomings in a compressed melody with losses on expensive equipment; a budget speaker will not have enough frequency range to compare compressed with and without losses.

<br><i style="color:rgb(1, 31, 202) ;">FLAC (Free Lossless Audio Codec)</i> is the top among containers for lossless audio. In size, a song in FLAC will be about half the size of the same one saved in WAV or AIFF, but in terms of sound, there are no noticeable differences, even on the coolest semi-professional headphones.

<br>In order to fit more songs on a CD without affecting the quality, you need to record files in FLAC. With a resolution of up to 32 bits and 192 kHz, this format is more compact - a minute of sound takes up to two times less free space on the drive.

<br><i style="color:rgb(37, 150, 27) ;">ALAC (Apple Lossless) and WMA Lossless (Windows Media Audio)</i> are two identical formats presented by the main competitors of the computer world Apple and Microsoft. They appeared a long time ago, but did not receive much distribution. Most players, smartphones and tablets will not be able to correctly play either ALAC or WMA Lossless without separately installed codecs or a special player. The size of files with this extension is larger than that of FLAC, which does not affect the sound quality in any way.

<br>The <i style="color:rgb(223, 22, 22) ;">MP3</i> format does not need an introduction - it seems that everyone knows and has heard of it. Initially, it appeared as a way to compress sound as compactly as possible. Remember how many albums you can fit on one MP3 disc for listening in compatible music centers and car radios.

<br>When memory was expensive and there was a huge gap between professional and home acoustic systems, it made sense to mercilessly compress music. Now MP3 is used very rarely, usually as ringtones in budget smartphones and for listening on them. The sound quality, even with a high bit rate, leaves much to be desired. That is why, over the past few years, MP3 has had several “loud” competitors with sound that is a cut above with the same compactness and good support by all operating systems.

<br><i style="color:rgb(233, 142, 6) ;">AAC (Advanced Audio Coding)</i> is an analogue of MP3, which, due to a more optimal encoding algorithm, allows you to preserve the sound of higher quality. This is the type of audio that YouTube uses, as well as many other streaming services, including the iTunes and Apple Music platforms.

<br><i style="color:rgb(172, 26, 230) ;">Ogg Vorbis</i> is a non-commercial codec that is not promoted much, which is in vain. The OGG container stores audio compressed to a certain degree and accompanying information - all sorts of tags and metadata - in the same form as MP3, but the quality and optimization during streaming in Vorbis are clearly better.
