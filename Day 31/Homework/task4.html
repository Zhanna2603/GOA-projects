    Introduction to embedding videos in HTML
    Embedding videos in HTML is an important skill for any web developer. Video can significantly enhance the user experience on your site by providing visual content that can be more informative and engaging than text or images. In this article, we will look at the basic methods of inserting videos into HTML, including using the video tag, adding attributes to control videos, as well as inserting videos from popular platforms such as YouTube and Vimeo.

    <br>Videos on web pages can perform many functions, from educational content to entertainment videos and promotional materials. It is important to understand how to insert a video correctly and effectively so that it is displayed correctly on all devices and in different browsers. In this article, we will take a detailed look at all aspects of embedding videos in HTML so that you can confidently use this tool in your projects.
    <br>The video tag also supports multiple video sources via nested source tags. This allows you to specify multiple video formats to ensure cross-browser compatibility. For example, you can add videos in WebM format for browsers that do not support MP4.
</p>


  <h3>Adding Attributes to Control Video</h3>

<p>The video tag supports a variety of attributes that allow you to customize the behavior and appearance of your video. Here are some of them:
    
    <br>autoplay: Automatically plays the video when the page loads.
    <br>loop: Loops the video, playing it again when it finishes.
    <br>muted: Mutes the video by default.
    <br>poster: Sets a splash image that appears before the video starts playing.
    These attributes allow you to flexibly customize your video depending on the needs of your project. For example, the autoplay attribute can be useful for commercials that should start immediately after the page loads, while the loop attribute is useful for video backgrounds that should play continuously.
