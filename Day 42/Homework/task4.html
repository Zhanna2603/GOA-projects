        <h1>Healthy lifestyle</h1>
    <p>A healthy lifestyle is a lifestyle of an individual with the purpose of preventing diseases and improving health. A healthy lifestyle helps us achieve our goals and objectives, successfully implement our plans, cope with difficulties, and if necessary, with colossal overloads. Strong health, supported and strengthened by the person himself, will allow him to live a long and joyful life.  
    Health is the priceless wealth of each person individually, and of the whole society as a whole. When meeting and parting with people close to us, we always wish them good health, because this is the main condition for a full and happy life.</p>

    <h2>The main factors that destroy health</h2>
        <h3>Psychoactive substances (drugs)</h3>
            <p>Addiction to the use of psychoactive substances (drugs) is a painful craving that leads to severe disorders, first of all, of the mental and physical functions of the body. It is no secret that drugs are poison. Regardless of the amount taken, they cause irreparable damage to our health.
            It is generally accepted that drugs should have three characteristics: gradual addiction, physical and psychological dependence. Physical dependence is expressed in the fact that in the absence of the drug, the addict's condition sharply worsens, pain, nausea, vomiting, and disorders of the internal organs appear, which is commonly called "withdrawal". Psychological dependence is manifested in the addict's readiness to do anything just to get the drug again. 
            The main danger of narcotic substances is that after taking them, an irresistible urge to use them again appears, and the addict no longer thinks about the deadly consequences that the drug conceals.</p>
                <p>Drugs penetrate the holy of holies of the body - they gradually destroy the nervous system of the addict, his brain, and do it cynically, and sometimes irreversibly. Disturbances affect the work of individual neurons, areas of the brain, in particular, those responsible for memory and semantic operations. This, in turn, directly affects a person's behavior, his professional activity decreases, he switches off from social activities, all his leisure time is occupied with thoughts about drugs. Hence frequent absenteeism and low productivity, termination of education at school or college, lack of any desire to take care of children, wife, sick parents, neglect of household chores. In other words, the addict degrades as a person, turning into a callous, limited egoist, occupied only with waiting for the next drug intoxication.
                All drugs, regardless of the route of administration into the body, to a greater or lesser extent necessarily damage: the nervous system (including the brain); the immune system; the liver; the heart; the lungs.</p>


        <h3>Smoking</h3>
            <p>Nowadays, smoking has become a deeply ingrained part of many people's lives and has become an everyday occurrence. Despite the public's struggle, the introduction of new requirements of the "anti-tobacco" law, part of the population still remains active smokers, while everyone realizes that nicotine is a powerful poison. In addition to nicotine, other components of tobacco smoke also have a negative effect. When carbon monoxide enters the body, oxygen starvation develops, due to the fact that carbon monoxide is more easily combined with hemoglobin than oxygen and is delivered with the blood to all organs and tissues. Frequent and prolonged smoking is associated with manifestations of physical discomfort: morning cough, headache, sharp unpleasant sensations in the stomach, heart, sweating, fluctuations in blood pressure, loss of sleep, appetite, memory loss. A person becomes nervous, irritable. In addition, smokers endanger not only themselves, but also those around them. Inhaling smoky tobacco air (passive smoking) leads to the same diseases that smokers suffer from. A smoker inhales smoke that has passed through a cigarette filter, while a non-smoker inhales completely unfiltered smoke. This smoke contains 50 times more carcinogens, twice as much tar and nicotine, 5 times more carbon monoxide and 50 times more ammonia than smoke inhaled through a cigarette. Therefore, stopping smoking is a prerequisite for a healthy lifestyle.</p>

        <h3>Alcohol</h3>
            <p>The problem of alcoholism is a complex of social pathologies that affect the normal functioning of society. Even small doses of alcohol reduce performance, lead to rapid fatigue, absent-mindedness, and make it difficult to correctly perceive events. Alcoholism is a severe chronic disease that is difficult to cure. It develops on the basis of regular and long-term alcohol consumption and is characterized by a special pathological condition of the body: an irresistible craving for alcohol, a change in the degree of its tolerance, and personality degradation. Alcohol has an extremely harmful effect on brain cells, paralyzing their activity and destroying them. Alcohol has a detrimental effect on the liver: with prolonged use, chronic hepatitis and cirrhosis of the liver develop. Drinking alcoholic beverages, regardless of the type of strength, leads to disruption of the heart rhythm, metabolic processes in the tissues of the heart and brain, and irreversible changes in these tissues. The whole society suffers from the consequences of alcoholism, but first and foremost the younger generation is at risk: children, teenagers, young people, as well as the health of expectant mothers.</p>

        <h3>Stress</h3>
            <p>Stress - translated from English means "pressure, pressure, tension". Any person is subject to stress, regardless of the position they hold, their social status and financial well-being. A tense emotional state has a negative impact on the psychological and physical condition of a person. Stress leads to psychoemotional disorders (anxiety, depression, neuroses, low mood, or, conversely, overexcitement, anger, memory impairment, insomnia). Stress is the main risk factor in the manifestation and exacerbation of many diseases: cardiovascular (hypertension, angina, stroke), gastrointestinal tract (ulcer, gastritis), colds and infections, which is explained by weakened immunity. It is impossible to remove most stress factors from our lives, but we can change our perception and neutralize their negative impact on our health and life in general.</p>
