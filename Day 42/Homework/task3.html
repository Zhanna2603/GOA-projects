<!-- 3) კომენტარებით ახსენით, რა არის CSS-ის წესი, დეკლარაცია, კუთვნილება და კუთვნილების მნიშვნელობა -->

<!-- Each CSS rule consists of two main parts: selectors and declarations. The declaration, in turn, consists of a property and a value.

The selector
A selector is a part of a CSS rule that determines which HTML elements styles will be applied to. There are several types of selectors, each of which has its own application.:

Selectors of tags (elements): apply to all elements of a certain type. For example, p for all paragraphs.
Class selectors: Apply to all elements with a specific class. For example, .class-name.
Identifiers: Apply to an element with a specific identifier. For example, #id-name.
Attribute selectors: Apply to elements with a specific attribute. For example, [type="text"].
Pseudo-classes: apply to elements in a specific state. For example, :hover.
Pseudo-elements: Apply to parts of an element. For example, ::before.

Declaration
A declaration is a part of a CSS rule that contains one or more properties and their values that define how selected elements should be styled.

Property
The property defines the aspect of the style that will be changed.

Meaning
The value specifies the specific change that will be applied. -->
