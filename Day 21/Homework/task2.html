<!-- The main information -->
    <p><b>Females</b> are much smaller than males. The body is elongated, flexible, the limbs are low, the hind legs are noticeably more massive, the head is relatively small. The tail is evenly pubescent along its entire length. The paws are wide with retracted claws; on the front – five, on the hind – four fingers. The coat is thick, dense, and short. The color is plain, gray-brown or brown-yellow, the underside is lighter. The end of the muzzle and throat are whitish or white, the ears are darker than the general color, and the tail has a black tip. In cubs, the body is covered with dark spots that merge into stripes on the paws and rings on the tail. The spots are clearly visible up to <u>9 months</u> and disappear completely at the age of<u> 2 years</u>. It lives mainly in the mountainous regions of western North America; in the recent past, the range of the cougar extended from southeastern Alaska to Patagonia. It inhabits various landscapes: from grassy open habitats to tropical forests. He avoids swampy areas in the tropics. It rises to a height of<u> 4700 m </u>in the mountains. It moves easily through the mountains, climbs trees well, and swims if necessary. It can make jumps up to <i>6 m</i> in length and up to <i>2.5 m</i> in height. On flat terrain, it can reach speeds of up to <i>50 km </i>per hour over short distances.The cougar<u> kills more prey than it can eat</u>, hides the uneaten prey and returns to it repeatedly. It is capable of dragging a carcass many times exceeding <em>(up to 8 times)</em> its own mass.</p>
