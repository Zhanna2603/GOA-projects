<h2>1.Hate is like Morse code</h2>
<img src = "Morse.jpg" left width="270">
   <p><b>Samuel Morse</b> is remembered today for his role in the development and commercialization of the telegraph, as well as for the code of the same name that he used to communicate. At the same time, everyone forgot about his unsuccessful political career, built on an anti-Catholic and anti-immigration platform. In <u>1834</u>, Morse joined the growing Nativist movement and began writing a series of articles under the pseudonym "Brutus" condemning the "Catholic conspiracy to destroy the American way of life."

    Morse's main targets were poor immigrants from Ireland and Italy, who "brought ignorance and Roman Catholicism with them." Many of Morse's friends and former followers were shocked by his outspoken views, but he became the leader of the Nativist party. In fact, they asked him to run for mayor of New York City in 1836. As a result, Morse took the last place among the candidates, but this allowed him to devote his time to working on the telegraph.</p>

<h2>2.The Destroyed Sketch</h2>
<img src = "Leonardo.jpg" left width="550">
   <p>Considering that <b>Leonardo da Vinci</b> is one of the most influential artists of all time, any of his work is considered invaluable. One has only to imagine the excitement in the <u>1990s</u>, when a previously unknown essay by a Renaissance master found among the drawings of Count Stefano della Bella of the XVII century was discovered.
    The sketch represented Orpheus being attacked by the furies. Special care had to be taken to preserve the sketch, so a team of restorers was called in, who... the priceless sketch was destroyed by treating it with alcohol and water, as a result of which the ink disappeared</p>

<h2>3.The shortest war lasted only 38 minutes (war between England and Zanzibar.)</h2>
<img src = "381896.png" left width="600">
    <p>"On August 7, 1896, the shortest 38-minute war in history took place </b>between the British and Zanzibar.</b> The story is as follows: At that time, Zanzibar was part of the British Empire in East Africa, and it was headed by Sultan Hamad bin Tuwaini, who was a protege of the British. But on <em>August 25, 1896,</em> the sultan died, and his nephew, Sultan Khalid bin Bargash, immediately seized power. But the British did not appoint him head of Zanzibar, and therefore did not recognize him in this capacity. 
        The British solved such "small problems" quickly and radically. And now <em>5 British</em> warships with landing troops have arrived at the island. An ultimatum was immediately sent to the Sultan: surrender to the mercy of the victor and leave the palace.  But the sultan had not yet had time to enjoy power (*one day is clearly not enough!), and therefore decided to "fight back" the arrogant British, and ordered artillery guns to be rolled out on the palace walls.
        <i>On August 26, 1896,</i> the Sultan rejected the last ultimatum of the British - and that meant war....
        At 9:2 a.m. on August 27, 1896, the British Royal Navy began firing cannons at the wooden palace. The palace was almost destroyed, the sultan fled, and at 9.40 a.m. the 38-minute war ended with an unconditional victory for the British.</p>

<h2>4.Arabic numerals</h2>
<img src = "0123456789.jpg" left >
<p></b>Arabic numerals,</b> as we know them today, were actually developed in India in the 1st millennium AD. They were first described in the Indian mathematical treatise "Brahmasphutasiddhanta", written by Brahmagupta in 628. This system was unique because it was positional and included the concept of zero.</p>

<h2>5.Braids were a sign of feudalism in China</h2>
<img src = "16441912.jpg" left width="450">
<p>There are many unique traditions in the history of China, but one of the most interesting and symbolic is the wearing of a braid. This hairstyle became an iconic feature of feudal China and had deep cultural and political significance.
    The braid, or <i>"Manchu braid"</i>, became widespread during the reign of the<u> Qing Dynasty</u> </b>(1644-1912).</b> After the conquest of China, the Manchu rulers introduced the mandatory wearing of a braid for all men to distinguish them from other ethnic groups and emphasize their dominance. Refusal to cut hair according to an established pattern was punishable by death. The phrase "Keep your scythe or you'll lose your head" literally became the embodiment of the political reality of that time.</p>
