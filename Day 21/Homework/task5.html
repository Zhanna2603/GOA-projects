<h2>1.Introduction with HTML</h2>
<h3>HTML Basics</h3>
<!-- Paragraph 1 -->
   <p>HTML <u>(Hypertext Markup Language)</u> is the code that is used to structure and display a web page and its content. For example, content can be structured within multiple paragraphs, bulleted lists, or using images and data tables. As the name suggests, this article will give you a basic understanding of HTML and its functions.</p>

   <h3>2.What is HTML?</h3>
   <!-- Paragraph 2 -->
   <p><b>HTML</b> <em>is not a programming language;</em> it is a markup language, and is used to tell your browser how to display the web pages you visit. It can be complex or simple, depending on how the web designer wants it. HTML consists of a number of elements that you use to embed or wrap various parts of the content to make the content appear or act in a certain way. Enclosing tags can make a word or image a link to something else, they can make words italicized, make the font larger or smaller, and so on. For example, take the following line of content</p>

   <h3>3.The anatomy of the HTML</h3>
   <!-- Paragraph 3 -->
<p>Let's look at the paragraph element in more detail.The main parts of our element are:
    <br></b>Opening tag:</b> Consists of an element enclosed in opening and closing angle brackets. 
    The opening tag indicates where the element begins or begins to act, in this case, where the paragraph begins.
    <br></b>Closing tag:</b> This is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes a slash in front of the element name. The closing element indicates where the element ends, in this case, where the paragraph ends.
    <br></b>Content:</b> This is the content of the element, which in this case is just text.
    <br><b>Element:</b> The opening tag, the closing tag and the content together make up the element.</p>

<h2>2.Introduction with CSS</h2>
<h3>CSS in simple words</h3>
<!-- Paragraph 1 -->
<p>CSS <u>(Cascading Style Sheets)</u> is a formatting language that allows you to make a website visually attractive, create complex web page templates and give them individuality. CSS makes HTML content well-organized, more beautiful and easier to read.
    
    <br>CSS is essentially rules that tell the browser how to display a certain element on a page. CSS gives the page visual beauty and is responsible for its aesthetics. In addition to changing basic parameters (such as indents, colors, and fonts), CSS is also used to optimize pages, create advanced visual effects (such as hover effects , various animations, etc.), and responsive web design.</p>

<h3>CSS Basics</h3>
<!-- Paragraph 2 -->
<p>Using CSS, we can set different styles for the entire text enclosed in an HTML element. <i>For example:</i> font size is 40 pixels, font is Arial, color is green. You can also set more serious parameters - <u>for example,</u> add borders, change margins, control the exact positioning of an element, and even add various effects and animations.

    <br>The style sheet tells the browser how to display the document being viewed. One important CSS concept is embedded in its very name - style sheets are cascading. This means that at least one stylesheet affects each web page.
    
    <br>Even when we don't use CSS, HTML elements have certain "default" styles (i.e., which are added by default by browsers). <i>For example,</i> text and title elements usually take up the entire web page. In this case, the links are placed in a row without splitting the text.
    
    <br>There is one default font and some spacing added to each element for ease of reading. Anything more than that already requires CSS to be enabled.
    
    <br>In most cases, it is best to refer not to multiple tables, but to a separate style sheet. In this case, it is much easier to manage it. You can have an unlimited number of documents linked to a single table - this allows you to edit styles more efficiently, unlike editing countless HTML documents.</p>

<h3>The possibilities and importance of CSS</h3>
<!-- Paragraph 3 -->
<p>
    CSS is one of the main tools for managing the design of web pages. Using it, you can change the look and feel of websites in any way you want, while saving a huge amount of time due to the smaller amount of code required.
    
    <i>To summarize, here are the key advantages of CSS:</i>
    <br><b>Flexibility </b>- CSS gives you the freedom to place HTML elements anywhere on the page, while keeping the HTML  markup organized and clean.
    <br><b>Cross-browser and cross-device compatibility</b> - you can customize the display of a web page by different browsers and on different devices, taking into account their differences and features. In other words, it is an opportunity to create different versions of web pages and sites using the same HTML document, adapting each version to the necessary parameters.
    <br><b>Huge customization options</b> - CSS allows you to make almost unlimited changes to page styles: colors, links, borders, hover and transition effects, fonts, etc.
    <br><b>Simplicity and efficiency</b> - the ability to easily create and customize styles for multiple web pages at the same time.
    <br><b>Save time</b> - you can write style sheets once and then reuse them for an unlimited number of pages.
    <br><b>High page loading speed</b> - CSS significantly reduces the length of the HTML code, which, in turn, leads to faster loading of web pages.</p>

<h2>3.Introduction with JS</h2>
<h3>What is JavaScript?</h3>
<!-- Paragraph 1 -->
<p><b>JavaScript</b> is an interpreted programming language that is used to write <i>frontend</i> and <i>backend</i> parts of websites, as well as mobile applications. Often in texts and training materials, the name of the language is shortened to JS. This is a high-level programming language, that is, the code in it is understandable and well-readable.

    <br>JS is supported by all popular browsers. In the frontend part of the sites, the language is used to create interactive<u>(animations, pop-up forms, autocomplete),</u> since it is associated with HTML and CSS and can manipulate them. The backend parts with the JavaScript language work on the platform Node.js . With its help, for example, they develop server-side web applications and connect libraries. The autocomplete string works in JavaScript in the Google search engine, and Netflix, Uber, eBay use it in their backend. For <u>6 years</u> now, JS has been the most popular language among developers according to GitHub.</p>

<h3>JavaScript Features</h3>
<!-- Paragraph 2 -->
<p>JS is a multi—paradigm language, as it supports different programming paradigms (styles) and features:

    <br><b>Object-oriented</b> — represents a program as a system of relations between objects — sets of data and functions.
    <br><b>Imperative</b>— in this style of programming, instructions are used that are executed sequentially, and variables are used to access data, the value of which can be rewritten during the calculation.
    <br><b>Functional</b> — in it, the calculation is based on mathematical functions. Since functional programming does not rely on variables that can change the value, the query results will always be the same.
    <br><b>Dynamic typing:</b> Variables in JavaScript do not require a data type declaration. They can change their type during execution, which makes the code more flexible, but also requires careful type management.
    <br><b>Event Handling:</b> JavaScript is a powerful tool for handling events on web pages. It can respond to user actions such as mouse clicks, keystrokes, and others.
    <br><b>DOM manipulation:</b> JavaScript can change the structure and content of a web page, providing dynamic content updates without reloading the page.
    <br><b>Asynchronous operations:</b> JavaScript allows you to perform asynchronous operations, such as downloading data from the server, without blocking the execution of other tasks.
    <br><b>Server-side JavaScript:</b> Using the Node platform.js JavaScript can be used on the server side to create high-performance and scalable web applications.
    <br><b>Many frameworks and libraries:</b> JavaScript has an extensive developer community and a large number of libraries and frameworks such as React, Angular, Vue.js, and others, which simplifies the creation of complex web applications.
    <br><b>Cross-platform:</b> JavaScript can be used to develop web applications on various platforms, including the web, mobile devices, and even the desktop.
    <br><b>Open Standard:</b> JavaScript is based on the open ECMAScript standards, which ensures its interoperability and extensibility.
    <br>Web pages are partially processed using JavaScript on the user's computer. This reduces the load on the server: some operations are performed without requests to it, which saves time and traffic.</p>

<h3>Where JavaScript is used</h3>
<!-- Paragraph 3 -->
<p>
    <br><b>The client part of web applications</b><u>(frontend).</u> This is the interface of the page, that is, everything that the user sees: content, buttons, feedback forms, menus. With the help of JS, the interface reacts to user actions (mouse clicks, keystrokes), and the language is also responsible for storing data and autofilling forms.
    <br><i>The backend of</i> <b>web applications.</b> The server code is written on the Node platform.js. For example, AJAX requests (asynchronous javascript and XML) work on JS, which are sent to the server in the background, without reloading the web page, and push notifications - pop-up messages in the browser, which are implemented using Comet technology. Such notifications come from a special Comet server that constantly maintains a connection with the browser. It is using JavaScript that this connection is established.
<br></b>Mobile applications for Android, iOS, Windows Mobile</b> — when you need a cross-platform application or adaptation of a web application, and Kotlin <u>(for Android)</u>and Swift<u>(for iOS)</u>languages are not enough, JavaScript is used.</p>
