<!-- Inheritance is the transfer of formatting rules for elements located inside others. Such elements are called children, and they inherit some style properties of their parents, inside which they are located.
Inheritance allows you to set the values of some properties once, defining them for top-level parents. Let's say you want to set the color and font for the main text. You just need to use the BODY selector, add the desired properties for it, and the color of the text inside paragraphs and other text elements will change automatically. -->
