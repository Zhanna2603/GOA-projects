    <p id="p1">Hiroshima is a modern city located on the largest island of the Japanese archipelago, Honshu, and was almost completely destroyed during the atomic bombing in 1945 at the final stage of World War II. In memory of this tragedy, the city opened the Peace Memorial Park with the ruins of the "Genbaku Dome" - one of the few buildings that survived near the epicenter of the explosion. Also worth visiting in the city is the Japanese promenade garden Shukkeien and Hiroshima Castle, surrounded by a moat and park. </p>
